# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, built a machine learning model that classifies the persons credit score as poor, standard or good.

There are two folders:
1. Credit Risk EDA 
   * This contains an EDA notebook on the Credit Risk Dataset of more than 32,000 rows

2. Credit Score Preprocessing and Prediction
   * The data set here is 100,000 rows large.
   * In this we have done an extensive data cleaning and preprocessing of the Data and then applied various models from SciKit-Learn to predict the category of Credit score of the input data. 
   * We have also used hyper parameter tuning as well as Feature Importance Selection to improve the Accuracy of the model.

This project is made for Data Analysis and Machine Learning implementation. 

<br>This project has been made by the collaborative efforts of Ayush Raj Tarway (BroadParadox) and Mayank Agrawal (Mayankag020) in Summer 2022 as a part of their machine learning exploration.
